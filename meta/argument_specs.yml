    short_description: Generate SSL certificate for a host from an internal CA
    description: |
      Generate SSL certificate and private key for a host which is signed by a locally-managed internal certificate authority (CA).
      The CA certificate can be used for external software to validate a given host is trusted and managed by ansible,
      or if ownca_trust_ca is set to true, then the CA certificate will be added to the host's trusted CA cert store.
